Hey, I'm Ben. 

This is a site where I try to write some stuff down about things I'm working on or learning. The goal is to have somewhere where I can have my notes since if I leave them in notebooks or in various projects they are easy to lose, also writing it like you are teaching it helps you learn better and solidify your ideas. Maybe there is a side-benefit for someone else if they ever see it.

I got degrees in mechanical engineering studying soft robots (doing the continuum mechanics, simulations, and controls), but I mostly stick to programming and math now.
