    <p>Geometric algebra, or Clifford algebra, is pretty fricken neat-o or at least I’d like to think it is.</p>
<p>One of the main claims is that it is a coordinate-free representation of geometric objects, but I don’t quite get the importance at this point.</p>
<p>The main thing thing revolves around the geometric product which I think looks like the most natural extension of the familiar scalar product.</p>
<p>Consider we have 2 collections of different dimensional objects (0, 1, 2, etc.) <code>a + b</code> and <code>x + y</code>. Now we multiply them, whatever that means. If it looks like scalar multiplication it would result in:</p>
<pre><code>ax + ay + bx + by</code></pre>
<p>Doing the multiplication in the opposite order we have</p>
<pre><code>xa + ya + xb + yb</code></pre>
<p>Now in the scalar product we have commutivity, but with higher dimensional objects lets just assume that doesn’t make sense for now. This means we have <span class="math inline">\(ab \neq ba\)</span>. We can get a little bit further by considering that the product can be split into a symmetric and antisymmetric part.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
ab = a\dot b + a\wedge b
\]</span></p>
<p>which we can rearrange to get</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
a\dot b = \frac{1}{2}(ab + ba)
\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[
a \wedge b = \frac{1}{2}(ab - ba)
\]</span></p>
<p>What do these mean? Hopefully someday that will be revealed.</p>
<p>Well what happens when we consider the same geometric object in this multiplication? Well it is obvious for the anti-commuting part we have:
<span class="math display">\[
a \wedge a = - a \wedge a = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>I think this is where I have technically diverged from the typically definition as the inner product for arbitrary multivectors is not symmetric just reducing, so it may have been more appropriate to just</p>
