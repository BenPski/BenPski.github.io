title: Variational Calculus
---

Variational calculus aims to solve optimization problems by finding the path extremizes the optimization, $$\min_q \\int_0^T L(q,\\dot\{q\}) dt$$, or finds a stable point with the variation of the objective, $0 = \delta(\int_0^T L(q, \dot{q}) dt$. This is a useful tool for posing optimization problems and mechanics problems.
