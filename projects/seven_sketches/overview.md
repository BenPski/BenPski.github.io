title: Overview

I'm working through the book [Seven Sketches in Compositionality](https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/7Sketches.pdf)
and I'm running through lots of paper just going through the first few sections.
Also, it is both interesting to implement some of the data structures and 
algorithms it takes to support some of the working out and some of these
features seem useful more broadly. So, I'm writing some code to help me out.

Here I'm just writing some of my thought process for the implementation. Not 
going to be too worried about optimization, at least not right away.
